# Multi-Label Classification



## Advantages of Multi-Label Classification:
<ul>
<li>Content-Based Retrieval</li>
<p>Nowadays, we can easily search desired items just by using the photo or item image without mention the item's name. For example, we can search many objects on google or some large e-commerce application by just upload the photo of the object we looking for. The Multi-Label Classification function provide convenience to online users search multiple target items easily, it enhance the ability of search engines to retrieve very specific queries of a given product photo.</p>

<li>Frame Translation</li>
<p>By using advantages of computer vision techniques, we can convert picture into words! Multiple object detection in single photo or video frames can contribute to scene understanding.</p>
</ul>

## Methods of multi-label classification
<ul>
<li>Full Softmax</li>
<p>Full softmax is consider one of the method, but it is inpractical when there is many class or category label.</p>
<li>Modify final layer of neural networks</li>
<p>One of the easier way is just to modify the neural network layer. In general of classification algorithm, the last layer for output prediction is using softmax layer</p>
</ul>
