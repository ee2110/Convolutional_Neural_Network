# Color Detection

According to RGB additive color model, the red, green, and blue color are mixing together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. In real world there are million colors based on different color system. 

HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value, also known as HSB or hue, saturation, brightness) are alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. 

In computer vision, each RGB color value is defined within a range of 0 to 255. It is more complex when dealing with tone of colors. Learn more about color quantization.

In one of the recent project, we are focus on paint or object color detection. The beginning is basic color recognition, maybe start from three additive primary colors, red, green and blue. Follow by more complex problem. The color detection is also challenging as object detection.
